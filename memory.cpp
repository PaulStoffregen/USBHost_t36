// Memory allocation for Device_t, Pipe_t and Transfer_t structures.
//
// To provide an Arduino-friendly experience, the memory allocation of
// these item is primarily done by the instances of device driver objects,
// which are typically created as static objects near the beginning of
// the Arduino sketch.  Static allocation allows Arduino's memory usage
// summary to accurately show the amount of RAM this library is using.
// Users can choose which devices they wish to support and how many of
// each by creating more object instances.
//
// Device driver objects "contribute" their copies of these structures.
// When ehci.cpp allocates Pipe_t and Transfer_t, or enumeration.cpp
// allocates Device_t, the memory actually comes from these structures
// physically located within the device driver instances.  The usage
// model looks like traditional malloc/free dynamic memory on the heap,
// but in fact it's a simple memory pool from the drivers.
//
// Timing is deterministic and fast, because each pool allocates only
// a single fixed size object.  In theory, each driver should contribute
// the number of items it will use, so we should not ever end up with
// a situation where an item can't be allocated when it's needed.  Well,
// unless there's a bug or oversight...
